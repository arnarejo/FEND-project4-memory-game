## How to play the Game?
To play this game, flip over any two hidden cards at a time to locate the matching ones. The game board consists of sixteen cards arranged randomly in a grid. To play this game,

* a player flips one card over to reveal its underlying number
* the player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same number
* if the cards match, both cards stay flipped over
* if the cards do not match, both cards are returned to their initial hidden state

The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
